== Description ==

Covr increases the security of your WordPress site by using multi-factor authentication. The plugin can be installed and configured in a matter of minutes.

Multi-factor authentication, also known as 2FA is a method of identifying a user with two different pieces of information. Covr is designed so that anyone can install it and feel secure knowing their site is protected.

= How it Works =

Covr uses your phone as a verification tool. When a request to log into your site is made, a push notification is sent to the Covr app on your phone to notify you of the login request. If you did not request to log in, you can deny the request - thereby denying access to imposters. If you are the one logging in, by approving it you grant yourself access to your site. 

= Powerful security =

Multi-factor authentication is the safest way to secure your site. It is widely used by some of the largest corporations in the world simply because it works. Covr lets you take control of your site’s security without having to worry about a thing.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin to your WordPress site.
1. Register your site with Covr Security AB.
1. Download Covr Security from your mobile app store and follow the setup
